He grew up in the Twin Cities and didn’t know much about tribes until he took this job. He values many things about his job, in particular the spirit of cooperation and strong land ethic that the tribe has We are on the shore of Dead Fish Lake. The Ojibwe term for this lake translates to “the place where the little Canadian woman lives” “Dead Fish” refers to the fact that the lake fish kills in the winter (shallow) 2.1.1 Intro to FDL “Fon du Lac” is a French term - “head of lake” The Ojibwe term for the reservation is “Nagaajiwanaang” which means “where the flowing water stops” St Louis River forms the N and E boundaries of the reservation Important travel route - intersection of St. Louis River and Lake Superior FDL people probably lived closer to Duluth when first arrived in this area. FDL is 1 of 7 Ojibwe bands in MN. There are 11 in WI. Many more bands in Canada Current population of FDL band members is ~4,000 people. Approx half live here on the reservation, and half elsewhere. Total native population in MN is ~57,000 US population of Ojibwe people is approx 170,000, similar population in Canada 700-800 years ago, FDL people were mostly living in New England states. The Dakota lived in this area of MN at that time FDL people had a prophecy that they had to move west to where “the food grows upon the water”. In their migration story, there were 7 fires or 7 stops along the way. The final stop would have been Spirit Island in the St. Louis River Estuary. FDL recently acquired Spirit Island Approximately 400 years ago, the FDL people arrived in this area In 1854, the La Pointe (sp?) Treaty established the FDL reservation and other reservations in MN. Estimated 100,000 acre reservation boundary on the map [at time of treaty signing or present?] When treaty signed, non-native population in this area was ~6,000. Just 50 years later the non-native population was 1.7 million! Huge European migration strained resources and changed politics 1854 - ceded territories established (see wood panel on sheet that Christian gave us) Ceded territories each represent a different treaty. FDL is a signatory to 3 of the ceded territories. FDL people have retained hunting, fishing, gathering rights on many [30 or 3 million??] acres. Christian emphasizes retained because the Native population always had these rights. US did not give the Native people these rights. Hunting, fishing, and gathering are very important to the Native population to maintain their sovereignty and lifestyles. Christian notes that it is an ongoing struggle for the bands to hold onto those treaty rights - cites band involvement in Polymet and Twin Metals Mines debates. Also notes that the goals of the bands and environmentalists are very similar - the bands do not want resources exploited. FDL Treaty Territory Map 2.1.2 Land Ownership Christian shows map of reservation - why does map show so much non-FDL ownership within the Reservation boundaries? Dawes Allotment Act in 1867 (? check date/sp): Timber and mining interests wanted access to resources on the reservation. Goals of the Act: Free up land for timber and mining interests, followed by European settlers “Civilize” Native people by introducing concept of private land ownership, farming FDL head of house entitled to 120 acres Others entitled to 80 acres Remaining open for settlement, mining/timber In total, half to two thirds of treaty lands were opened up to settlement in the Dawes Allotment Act. Christian notes that the Twin Cities and Chicago are built on timber that came off native lands. Rivers were important transport mechanisms for moving timber. White Pine in particular has the unique property of floating in water. On the maps Christian gave us, orange = County land When people [settlers] tried to farm this land, found it unfavorable. They basically attempted to drain wetlands and plant potatoes and corn. Christian notes that many of these early European settlers were uneducated, impoverished people with little knowledge of farming. Essentially peasants without other options. When farming attempts failed on the land, the properties went tax forfeit and the County took ownership In the last 14 years, FDL has purchased 6,000 of these “orange” (County) acres as they have come up for sale. * FDL is buying County and private land whenever possible. Christian notes Potlatch (company?) has sold off lots of assets in MN. State land - more tax forfeit White color on map - private property Green colors - multiple types of ownership by tribe Allotment Band/Trust: Owned by band, not individuals) Fee Land: Band pays taxes on the land Christian emphasizes that different types of ownership have implications on management. Allotment is the most onerous to manage - hard to set up timber sales, etc. FDL Land Use Map 2.1.3 Resource Management Program FDL has a well-developed Resource Management Program, one of the best developed, multi-faceted programs Air Program Energy Program (solar, biomass boiler heating (for community center?), wood waste (?) Fisheries - example of successful sturgeon stocking into St. Louis River Estuary Natural Resources Water/Wetlands/Groundwater Program RM Program has 7-8 staff now, 10 when fully staffed Community service RM Program helps out after wind storms, bad snow storms. Help people cut tress out of driveways, yards. Clean up * Emergency management for floods FDL Resource Management Program Brochure from Christian 2.1.4 Wild Rice Dead Fish Lake (where we are standing) is 1 of 5 important wild rice lakes on the Reservation. The lake is ~60 acres in area Christian notes that in a month and a half, this lake will look like a hayfield! Wild Rice = Izania palustris. Is an annual plant related to grass. Ripens in falls and some falls into lake and overwinters. It germinates in the cool mucky bottom of the lake. In spring when it is growing, Christian notes the important “floating leaf stage”. Not yet strong enough to stand up on its own, very sensitive to fluctuating water level. This is why it’s important to have some water control structures (dam/impoundment) We saw the deep, linear drainage ditches on our drive in - these were put in between 1909-1915. 1909 was date of “Judicial Ditching Law”, which allowed any homesteader to petition to have their land drained for free to promote farming. Sometimes, they would do a whole township at a time. The result was a whole network of ditches dug to drain bogs, wetlands and swamps The ditching drastically changed the hydrology in northern MN. Before: Natural stream beds that evolved after the glaciers retreated had shallow banks, overflowed regularly to deposit rich soil in the surrounding floodplain. After big storms water was slowed, ponded, stored in the landscape After: Drainage ditches and channels can’t overflow their banks to renew the floodplain. Lost the floodplain effect, groundwater recharge opportunities too. After big storms water moves very quickly out to Lake Superior. Huge disruption to wild rice in the floating leaf stage! 2012 - extreme flood, disaster for wild rice. Harvesting wild rice Rice gets 6-8 ft tall. The ricer (harvester) uses knockers/flails made from cedar to bend rice and knock it down into the bottom of the boat. While the harvester works, another person (the poler) uses a ricing pole with a wider base to push into the loose mucky soil Poler stands in the back of the boat, ricer in the front Late season hail or winds can prevent fall harvesting. More frequent summer storms threaten harvesting, can degrade rice habitat Good rice harvesters can fill a boat with 350 lbs of rice in 5-6 hours Group observes trumpeter swans on the lake - they are a success story in some ways. Trumpeter swans were once on the endangered species list. Now their population is ~18,000. However, they also eat LOTS of wild rice - seeing this especially at FDL in the last 3 years. The swans can create big holes in the rice lakes 2.1.5 Soil Investigations -- near Dead Fish Lake -- MHN 44 (Mesic Hardwood North) Group observes mound from tree throw in the woods Don’t have many spodosols here in MN - we are a little too dry. You can find good spodosols in Michigan (UP), N WI. GUTTER 1 - upland near road - Omega Series Textures are loamy fine sand over sandy clay loam Thin E horizon, spodic Bs/Bhs Redox at less than 1m indicates local perching effect Mixed influence from Superior outwash and Superior till deposited on top of one another We are standing near a small ridge - can see on LIDAR. Christian’s theory is that the water level in the lake to the west of us (Dead Fish Lake) was once higher. Every few years ice in the spring would get pushed [by the wind] over the course of hours and days, scraping up the shoreline and mounding it here (ice ridges). This is why we see a narrow ridge with a different soil type along the road. There are a few other lakes in this area where you see a similar pattern - they have long, open west exposures and a similar pattern of ice ridges. Typically loamy fine sands are associated with eolian sands - but this is not the case here. GUTTER 2 - lowest position in woods - Aquept (doesn’t quite make spodosol) O A E Bs What was the vegetation like here pre-settlement? 1918 Cloquet Fire + ditching + logging created huge disturbances in the ecosystem. This area was historically wetter. The vegetation we see today is earlier successional compared to what would have been here pre-settlement. Lost lots of forested wetland (spruce swamps and tamarack bogs) due to ditching. White pine has been replaced with earlier successional aspen Previously would have expected a greater coniferous component. Historical coniferous vegetation fits with the soils we see here. Spodosols require albic E horizons, 4/2 and into upper left corner of color page. Horizon below has to be 4/4 or darker. 2.1.6 Blueberries We passed the retired forester in his car on the way in - he was here to check out the blueberry patch that they have been burning for the last 5-7 years. Historically, the blueberries were maintained by fire from lightning or purposeful fire that the Native Americans lit. Native Americans have a long history of burning for management, using fire as a tool to open up areas. Want to burn blueberries in the spring when they are dormant is soil is a little wetter. Commercial blueberry growers cut the plants back every 2-3 years to keep plants vigorous. When Christian and other resource mgmt staff burn this area, they make fire breaks by the road and in the woods. Use drip torches and try to work with a wind from the east to push fire toward the lake. Blueberries are primarily pollinated by black flies According to one member of the Grand Portage Band, it was traditional to burn blueberry plants after picking - possibly a fire of convenience? Types of prescribed burns Habitat management - burn shorelines Food burning - blueberries Fuel reduction burn - burn fuel to reduce intensity of future wildfires Burning shorelines maintains these areas in early successional vegetation. Although these areas have fewer species, they have more rare species (according to the Lake State Fire Consortium) FDL does prescribed burning AND wildfire suppression - this means they are very busy! Need to carefully management resources and labor. Have dual goals and responsibilities 2.2 2nd Stop - Ditchbank Road &amp; woods nearby [WFN 55 Black Ash Stand] We are observing the drainage diches. In 1909 they used steam shovels to dig “Ditchbank [Forest??] which is where we are now. In 2012 this whole area was completely underwater during some very bad flooding. Could only get in by air boat. The birches survived the flood better than the aspens. FDL Forest Type Emerald Ash Borer Found in MI in 1999 and spreading. In 2013 found in Park Point WI. Adult beetles can fly up to 12 miles MN has more ash trees (~1 billion) than any other state in the nation (MI held this title before the Emerald Ash Borer came…) Now we are gathered in a black ash stand. There are ~2 square miles of black ash stands in FDL. Black ash is unique, only species that seems to tolerate these sites with really wet periods, high water table, but in the summer can get drought and dry out. Emerald Ash Borer could create 1 million UNFORESTED wetlands if we lose black ash trees. This is because the black ash moderate the water table through transpiration. When transpiration stops, water table goes up. This might create an environment that is too wet for other tree species. Christian calls this the “bathtub theory.” The trees are little straws that keep the bathtub half full. With extreme rain events, have lost ability for water to settle, infiltrate. Water runs off. If we lose ash stands in the headwaters and tailwaters of wild rice areas, you get more surface runoff from summer storms and more frequent disruptions for the wild rice In the Chippewa National Forest they are experimenting with 13 non-ash species in these ash stands. Trying to see if any survive and could replace the hydrological function of black ash. Christian is doing a similar experiment in FDL too. Shannon Kessner - wetland specialist We are standing in 1 of the 6 experimental sites here. Each site has 200 trees, 5 different species. Silver Maple River Birch** this species is doing the best so far, is native to SE MN Red Maple Northern White Cedar Balsam Poplar Biggest challenges with this tree experiment are deer and hare browse. By Dead Fish Lake, have tried planting swamp white oak and burr oak. Jeff explains MN DNR’s Ecological Classification scheme - uses native plant communities to indicate ecological conditions Format is: XXX ## e.g. WFN 55 First number: moisture scale 1-9 (low to high) Second number: nutrients Scale 1-9 (low to high) Knowing the classification of a site informs us about what other species might do well here We are in a WFN 55. WFN 64 would also be a black ash stand, but wetter Indicator species, both canopy and sub-canopy, and also soils are used to determine the native plant community classification. NRI - UMN Duluth. George Host and others have looked into taking soil maps and native plant communities and figuring out how we cross-walk between them. Need to consider other site factors such as water table. Nic/Jeff idea: this could be an opportunity for machine learning - cross-walking native plant communities and soils. Combine soil series, LIDAR, and plant communities maps. Possibliity for a LCCMR study? These experiments are so important because time is limited - trying everything they can in the time they have. There are consequences beyond losing this unique habitat. Black ash is a unique cultural species - to the Ojibwe it is known as “auga-makk” [sp?], which translates to “snowshoe making trees” Black ash is a ring porous species. If you cut it down and pound on it, the tree will split at the annual growth rings. Get thin pieces of wood that can be used for making baskets and snowshoes. Culture, land, and resources are all intertwined. Can’t have one without the other. Losing black ash is a death to parts of the Ojibwe culture. Christian’s idea - cut down some black ash, bury deep in Lake Superior, fish them out later for ceremonial purposes. One way to preserve these precious trees in the anoxic conditions deep in the lake. Von Poss Scale - way to estimate organic decomposition 1-3: Fibric, holds lots of free water, when you squeeze clear water comes out 4-7: Hemic 7+: Sapric, when you squeeze little or no water comes out (organic material might squish between your fingers) Possible that worms we saw earlier [in the forest] were transported on steam shovels. Nic’s guess is that the organic layers we are seeing here are much thinner than they used to be historically Interpretation of landscape: We are on a lakebed here. The lacustrine sediment here tnds not be as clayey. More sandy, fine sand from short term lakes Uplands here are Superior Lobe Till Flat landscapes are outwash plains or lake beds 2.2.1 Soil Investigations-- Ditchbank Road &amp; woods nearby [WFN 55 Black Ash Stand] GUTTER 1 Oa (sapric) less than 10cm Bw Cg - very fine sandy loam Soil map unit here same as by Dead Fish Lake, but we have different vegetation GUTTER 2 In the uplands here you see glacial till, erratics, coarse fragments. In this gutter we have a more upland soil. 5YR / 7.5YR sandy loam with coarse fragments. Spodosols are developing on sandy areas with good infiltration &amp; pine trees In this are we see local loess deposition. Geologists have only mapped this when it is &gt;1m thick, but Nic has made a map of thin loess in N MN for soil series w/ thin loess/silt caps on the Eastern side of lakes Review: so far we have seen three soil orders: an upland alfisol, inceptisol, and a spodosol 2.3 Third Stop - Hardwood Thinning Project -- MHN 35 or 47 Species we see here: sugar maple, basswood, yellow birch “Asbestos forest” ?? We are in a hardwood thinning project on land acquired from Pot Latch 15 years ago. This area was cut ~20 years ago. Historically probably had richer component of hardwoods. Northern hardwoods are wind driven in terms of disturbance (not fire) Should see a rich layer of sugar maple seedlings if this area isn’t too impacted by earthworms. Chrisitan guesses there are lots of earthworms here because: Lack of maple seedlings Less diverse understory plants (lots of Pennsylvania Brome Grass) Northern hardwood systems often clearcut in the 1800s-1900s. Clearcutting has a huge impact on the system, letting in lots of sunlight all at once. Burns up the maple seedlings and allows sun-loving species like aspens to grow. Management at this site - trying to actively manage to get back to the piecey, patchwork canopy as it was historically (caused by windthrow). EQIP offsets the cost of labor out here Species composition When site purchased: 80% aspen/birch and 20% hardwood Now: 50% aspen/birch and 50% hardwood 40 years in future: 30% aspen/birch and 70% hardwood Can remove more aspen and birch in a commercial timber sale 40 years from now, which will help adjust the species composition and allow them to keep the shade loving trees Many other agencies don’t invest the same resources in resotring these unique ecological and cultural communities. FDL looking beyond economics. Ultimately htis is about landowner objectives Christian speaks about professional ethics - there is a professional obligation to let his employer know what is on the table in terms of ecological &amp; environmental consequences GUTTER - Hardwood Thinning Project Textures - medium sands - more outwash. This is an inceptisol. Don’t see an O layer here because of the earthworms. A : over-thickened, past disturbance, presence of earthworms E Bw C We are on a boundary here between map units. One unit is till, one is outwash. 2.3.1 Earthworms Sugar maple seedlings are sensitive to drying out. Ideally you want a nie thick layer of duff to help them stay cool and moist. Once earthworms are at a site, this duff layer disappears. The earthworms also increase compaction and change the nutrient cycling Worms actually prefer sugar maple leaves because they are rich in Ca. The worms can use Ca in reaction to breathe underwater. If we were in a non-earthworm site, the ground would feel much more spongy under our feet in a northern hardwood site “Root gingivitis” : When earthworms move in, they eat the duff layer and expose roots aboveground. The trees start to show drought stress when they have to grow new find roots into the mineral soil 2.3.2 Christian’s Career Story Undergrad major was wildlife Did forestry work through an internship. That internship is why he is here today! Went back to school for forestry *Worked short-term jobs for a while, bounced around What Christian looks for when he is hiring: Make yourself in expert (in something) Hit the ground running "],

May 29, 2019 3.1 Northwoods Organics &quot;The Moss is Boss&quot; Roy &amp; Vic 3.1.1 Peat harvesting Go through with harrow to spike/fluff the peat. Use spoons (“hockeys”) to pile into windrows. Peat has to be dry when you pile it, or you can start a fire! Have lost lots of peat to fires in the piles within the last year. &gt;2,500 yds^3 lost last year due to fire. Took &gt;80,000 gallons of water and 5 fire depts to put out the fire Peat harvester is like a vacuum cleaner. Giant fan creates suction to suck peat up into a 20 yd^3 bin They harvest less than 1 inch at a time after it has been harrowed to fluff it Harvesting is weather dependent, much like cutting hay. Has been too wet recently, haven’t been able to get in the field. Typically they would have 4,000-5,000 yds^3 by now Have a couple types of harvesters. The smaller ones they can pull behind a tractor. Bigger one stands alone. When it’s dry they need to be careful about fire when dust is thrown up near motor on harvester, can start a fire this way too. Sometimes they get complaints from neighbors about dust generated during bagging and harvesting. New home built 0.25 miles from their main field Workflow - if the weather is nice, working in the field. Peat can sit piled for months before they bag it. In winter they bag and do maintenance Important to regularly take temperature of the piles. 125F is the max temp they allow a pile to reach before breaking it open to avoid fires. Must break open piles slowly, otherwise a fire could start very quickly with the rapid influx of oxygen Can typically smell a fire before you see it. They carry water and spray bottles on the back of equipment at all times so they can deal with fires or smoldering areas immediately. Vic &amp; Roy want to get a heat gun so they don’t have to climb piles to take the temperature! We visited a 300 acre field that was being actively harvested (starting in the late 1980s). Still have 150 acres to open up in this area. On Highway 7 they have leased land with 2,000 acres that have not yet been opened up for harvesting. 3.1.2 Peat Bagging Texture of peat and moisture level make a big difference when trying to bag - important to keep bags consistent Northwoods Organics sells bags in 2.2, 3.8, and 3.0 cubic feet. They will produce 32,000 bags this year Sell just peat, they don’t mix any products like potting soil on site Tractor Supply and Blaine are big customers that buy the product. Can get very dusty in bagging facility, takes ~2 weeks to get used to how dusty it is even with masks on. Need to be careful about fires in the plant too Workers here start at $11/hour (they are hiring!) Baling machine can be dangerous if workers aren’t careful - there have been injuries Baling process: Raw peat goes in hopper bed. Big sticks fall through screen and are kicked outside Small sticks kicked out by rubber stars and slots Peat goes through pin auger (?), big chunks to hammer mill to process it finer. 3.1.3 Challenges Labor is limited Weather can prevent harvesting or bagging. They were shut down for 2.5 months in the winter because it was too cold to bag. Sometimes maintenance / repairs of the baling machine cause temporary shutdowns Sometimes truckers are late to pick up an order, need to wait before their order can be loaded 3.1.4 Mercury Need to test outlet waters and ponds once a month for Hg if there is any water flowing through the gates/rain notches. Roy wants to know how much Hg in the peat - how much do they come into contact with at work? Nic to send Roy elemental analysis. Most of the S in the soil is in the organic portion Hg and S form functional groups that are closely tied together. When Hg is deposited on soil, it is quickly bound to S in organic matter There are both anthropogenic and naturally occuring forms of Hg Hg &amp; S leach naturally from peatlands, but the process of harvesting releases much more. When tree cover is removed, temperature of the peat increases, which increases Hg and S cycling. Even in a natural peatland you would see this pattern of increased cycling with increased temperature. Peat Field - Map Units 3 map units out here. 1 fibrist and 2 hemists. We observed more fibric peat in the newly opened field. 3.2 Stop at Bog near Northwoods Organics APN 90 = forested bog APN 81 = poor confier swamp True bogs get water from precipitation only, no groundwater to contribute richer conditions in terms of minerals, etc. True bog species: leatherleaf, bog rosemary, cranberries Fen wire sedge present here (indicative of somewhat richer conditions) Tamaracks occur in richer conditions, but can also occur in poorer conditions pH less than 4.2 = bog ; pH&gt;4.2 = not bog Can sometimes see layers of charcoal in bog cores from when it burned Class learns how to use the Macaulay Auger, classifies haplohemist USDA method for determining rub fiber (Nic has opinions about this method) Form ball Crack ball open Rub 3 times between thumb and forefinger Estimate % fibers remaining Terric histosols - when you hit mineral within 1m qualifies as terric Peatland formation Peatland formation is complex! Broadly, two terms to know: Terrestrialization - peatland forms in a water body such as a lake in a cold environment Paludification - landscape scale process, peatland forms on top of lake sediment (clay) Tree species can tell us something about parent material in this area: Aspens growing on Des Moines Lobe Glacial till, which would have been islands in the glacial lake Black spruce, tamarack, peat growing over heavy clay glacial lake sediment 3.3 Stop at Sungrow Landscape positions for next stop illustration Reminders: Histosols have greater than or equal to 40 cm organics Histic epipedo has 20-40cm organics White cedar - more nutrient rich environment Black spruce - more nutrient poor environment Sungrow is no longer operating. Were once a small operation, ~4 full time employees Looking at drainage ditches (Morgan gets in). Water flows from the exterior ditches around the peat fields, out of the operation, to this ditch near the road. Site managers must record water level and take samples per their Mines permit. Typically see an increase of Hg export with peat harvesting Settling ponds collect water from the external field ditches. Allows fine particulates to settle, slows water. * The natural hydrology is a state of stagnant GW - we have “re-plumbed” the landscape here. Sungrow used to sell to Lowes and Home Depot.

When the depressions stays connected to the water table, you get a lake like the one right outside the window. GW level is the key factor determining why some lakes become peatlands and some don’t. Paludification - when a limiting layer causes water to accumulate, peatland can form The peat at the south corner of Marcell is 11m deep!! Peatland Functions Peatlands make up 3% of the terrestrial area, but store 30% of soil carbon. However, this might be starting to change In the recent years when they have had a warm fall, see the experimental peatlands become a C source.

Geologic: cinnebar, volcanic deposits ~20% of the Hg deposition here in US is from China. Hg levels here are levelling off, but will start to increase as industry development continues in China Example of Beijing 2018 Olympics shutting down coal Methyl mercury is the organic form that accumulates in the food chain To produce methyl mercury, need low oxygen, a food source (dissolved C), and sulfate. Prior to the industrial revolution and extensive coal burning, there were still some areas of Hg accumulation that occured naturally. Hg accumulates in soil in elemental form. Can look at Hg in sediment cores and see the rise of industrial development with the rise in concentration of Hg.

SPRUCE is the largest climate change experiment on the planet! Why study peatland responses to warming and increased CO2? DOE interested in peatlands to better predict future energy needs. Wetlands &amp; peatlands are poorly modeled in climate models With climate change, see greater temperature shifts at higher latitudes SPRUCE Experiment Experimental design is a regression, not ANOVA Greenhouses are 12m in diameter, 8 m high 5 levels of warming, 2 of CO2. Elevated CO2 approaching 900ppm Most novel aspect of SPRUCE is belowground heating - 6 foot filament (like a lightbulb) in tube in ground. Heats area around filament Temp is altered as a differential from the outside air - so if outside air temp is 10C, it will be 19C in the warmest chamber DOE wants response surfaces to parameterize their models Timeline 2014 - belowground heat started 2015 - aboveground heat started 2016 - elevated CO2 started The chambers go all the way into the mineral material below Stratified the location of chambers based on depth of peat and # trees. Wanted moderate # trees in each (15-25), and consistent peat depths 2 official unchambered controls are part of the experimental deisgn Each chamber costs &gt;$1 million Sensors up and down chambers control CO2 and temp regulation. Requires 2 semi tanks of propane in the winter EACH WEEK to keep things heated and running Interesting early results Wilson et al 2016 Nature “Deep heating: Does it Effect Old C?” Initially it appears the old C is less susceptible to belowground warming In warmest temps, lost 5cm of peat in the first few years Losing species: lichens, black spruce, tamarack Winning species: aricaceous (sp?) shrubs, blueberries Gill et al 2017 Greenhouse gas fluxes McPartland et al 2018 NDVI: Normalized differential vegetation index Temperature changes the phenology of plant communities Future of SPRUCE - USFS Electrical draw for the experiment is equivalent to a city of 200 people Costs $2million a year to run This experiment is a testament to the strength of US science and the importance of government funding. No other entity could do this - most other countries don’t have this kind of support. Scientists from China visited SPRUCE last fall looking at the experiment, seeing how they could replicate it. 4.1.6 Infrastructure of the Experimental Forest Weirs - open year-round for measurements, flow and concentration Chart recorder w/ pen to measure height of H20 in notch and create hydrograph, precise measurement of flow out of watershed The peatland drives the amount of water coming out. Upland water contribution is big during snowmelt These were conifer landscapes before settlement. In 1980s, had a demo site to see if they could restore conifers to watershed upland areas that were dominated by aspen and birch. Suppressed aspen and conifer with herbicide and also tried grazing cows. Learned that it took ~2 months for the cows’ guts to adjust to the new forage source. Also learned that herbicides are more cost efficient than cows for this work. Water flow after tree harvest Immediately after a tree harvest, water flow increases (you have removed straws from the landscape that were sucking out water). About 10 years after the harvest, flow returns to about the same as pre-harvest. Now, only half of that flow is coming out of the watershed because the conifers have a longer transpiration season than aspen &amp; birch (conifers don’t lose their leaves!) Interception is another reason for reduced water flow out of the watershed. Conifers intercept the water. In winter you lose water by sublimation the snow 1800s-1900s had less water on the landscape. Now there is more water on the landscape because deciduous trees have replaced the trees that were cut down Microbes use sulfate as an electron acceptor so they can use mercury to make methyl mercury Sulfate comes from acid rain, smoke stacks Sprinkler system experiment - added amount of sulfate that would have been present in 1970s pre-Clean Air Act (4X what we have today) for 8 years. Trying to see if they can stimulate the methyl mercury production with sulfate Did this to downstream part of bog (1/20 of the watershed). Start to see 2X the methyl Hg coming out of the treatment (downstream) compared to the control (upstream) Within just a few years small pike are showing a blip of Hg, increased Hg concentration in mosquito larvae within 3 years. In that same time, the Hg concentration decreased by half in control compared to where they kept depositing sulfate Took 5-6 years to recover to ambient levels of Hg Consider this impacts wild rice - pore water concentrations of sulfate in wild rice lakes/backwaters has a direct relation to health of the rice Hg does accumulate in wild rice - need to be careful where we put power plants, think about where they will deposit Hg Boswell big polluter of Pokegama Lake 4.1.7 S2 Reference Watershed, Lagg Zones 105 year old aspen birch ecosystem that is currently going through succession (not great). Life span of aspen is about 105 years We see 2 different ecosystems here: Uplands: mature aspen and birch, soil is Warba (Wadena lobe). Calcareous down below, higher pH. More nutrients, more sulfate. Not much DOC Bogs: Edges are lowest part. Edge has distinct plant community influenced by upland H20. Edge = lagg, where water meets at edge In the lagg, upland and lowland waters come together. The mixing of these 2 waters with different chemistries from different landscapes creates a biogeochemical hotspot Methane, N2O production, methyl-Hg greater in the lagg 2 water collectors built in the 1970s First one captures surface runoff from under the litter [that’s where we are standing right now] Second one collects subsurface water with a perforated pipe in the Bt horizon of the Warba soil Right now, no water in collectors (no upland contribution). This means that all the water we see coming out of the weir is from the peatland. At this time, there is no (hydrological) connection between upland and peatland – but during snowmelt the upland contribution is significant and the collectors fill up several times per day The lagg zone is very fen-like thanks to the influence of upland water (more nutrients) Plant species diversity: In bog, lower diversity, less nutrients, lower pH limits which species can grow. Trees grow very slowly in the bog – the ones we see here are ~165 years old, but are only 4-6 inches in diameter. 150 mg/L DOC from bog In lagg, see ~25 different plant species thanks to the more nutrient-rich conditions 4.2 Visiting the SPRUCE Experiment Greenhouses Started April 1, 2009 and took 5 years before they could start treatments. Project required all kinds of permitting, NEPA environmental assessment Economic assessments of the project predicted $500,000 contributions each year to the local economy. In reality the contribution has been closer to $750,000. This has turned some skeptics into supporters because of the local economic impact. Security – zero vandalism for more than 8 years. Wildlife are actually a bigger problem than people CO2 they add to chambers is labelled 13C to track carbon going through the plant community. It was a challenge to source the labelled CO2! Had to get it from Iowa. Cost is $3.5 million per year in electricity, propane, CO2 costs Project has attracted $700 million from other granting agencies (outside of DOE). These include NSF, other universities Introduction to Robert Nettles - he is responsible for running SPRUCE systems and heaters 24/7, 365 days a year. Joined SPRUCE after leadership of FACE experiment at Duke University Building SPRUCE 2012-2013 during winter all boardwalks were built (had to do it when the ground was frozen in order to get out on the peat Local contractors got primary bid for building the chambers, with 10-12 subcontractors involved 2013-2014 during the winter – all chambers built! Even during -20F weather, SPRUCE construction was still active trying to get the work done before the melt (and the peat softens up) Experimental Artefacts of the Chambers The acrylic panels of the chambers let in 95% of light. Other infrastructure blocks an additional 3% of light, so only 92% get through Greenhouse effect contributes 0.1-0.25degrees Humidity in chambers is lower than ambient (due to the heaters and blowers) No wildlife browse in the chambers, which means no additional nutrients added from wildlife waste ~95% of rain and ~83% of snow makes it into the chambers Reduced seed input (seed rain) into chambers compared to outside About the SPRUCE Chambers Each chamber has its own control panel All controls connected with fiber optic cable, high speed internet so Robert (SPRUCE manager) knows immediately if something goes wrong Lower chamber (below peat) formed from interlocking panels and foam that expands when wet. This makes the area below the chamber water tight like it has its own watershed. In spring they let the lower chambers drain so they don’t create a pond When constructing the chambers, couldn’t disturb anything inside the donut-shaped space that would be the study area, required very careful construction Monitoring &amp; Measurements in the Chambers Middle tower in the chamber controls temp, CO2 for aboveground regulation. Can use ladders to access this inner part of the chamber There are 3 locations belowground that monitor soil temp. Air temp and soil temp are controlled independently – both are managed to be certain number of degrees different than ambient temperature The boardwalks are drilled down 40 feet Notice higher density of shrub layer in this chamber, the appearance of the tamarack and black spruce (they look sad, bare spots, dead branches) Some trees are having transpiration measurements via the heat dissipation method Dendrometer band measures diameter of tree sensitively on day/night basis Trees take up water during day, transpire it at night Dendrometer can measure changes that are tenths of a millimeter! Seed collecting funnel Automated mini rhizotron measuring root productivity in tube. Tree experts are able to tell the functional group of the roots Measuring surface elevation of peat Tubes w/ syringe on top – measuring pore water concentration of dissolved gases like CO2, N2O, methane Eddy covariance – can measure ecosystem level C fluxes at fine scales. All about the physics of air parcel movement. However, chamber prevents this air movement. Haven’t found a way to measure the chamber-level fluxes of gases.

Measuring Hg fluxes in chambers (Nater, Toner, etc) They maintain the windspeed in the chambers as an average of the 24/7/365 winds of northern MN Have seen very few CO2 effects on anything they are measuring (so far). Effects of the heating are much more apparent at this point Right now SPRUCE team keeping their heads down with the current presidential administration – hoping to get on NPR’s Science Friday in a couple years to talk about all of the work they are doing Check out DOE SPRUCE website for a list of publications 4.3 Chatting after lunch at Marcell: Dome part of bog only receives water from precipitation – hydrologically isolated 25 g C/m^2/year is average accumulation of carbon [from sphagnum growth??] ~1 inch of peat accumulates every 100 years So when did most of this peat form? Hypsothermal period 4500-6000 years ago. Warmer, wetter time. Productivity outpaced decomposition more then compared to today Landscape positions with till, bog, water relationships Dome part of bog only receives precipitation, it is hydrologically isolated, pH 5.5-5.6. The lagg does receive subsurface water flow, typically has more nutrients and a higher pH. Lagg environment is a zone of much more active decomposition because of the increased nutrients Upland soils in the north central region Trees &amp; understory vegetation tell you parent materials (2 main types) Till (Wadena Lobe) – hardwoods, aspen, maple Outwash (sandy loams, sands) – pine Why does a raised bog form in the middle? Feedback loop – starts with hydrological isolation, continues to grow, becomes more isolated, etc 4.4 “Tweener” Site : First stop after lunch @ Marcell Aspen &amp; maple understory, pines in overstory. This is probably outwash with different deposition events, including very fine sandy loam that holds up moisture, creates redox features and a richer environment (as seen by vegetation). Lamellae – these are geogenic lamellae, were formed when outawash was laid down. Contrast with pedogenic lamellae.

Lots of his job is collaborative. Trie has treaty rights that need to be addressed. Also does general forest management duties.Has been in his position for 13 years starting in June. Grew up in MN Interns Cole &amp; Keegan 5.2 Site #1 in Chippewa Nat’l Forest FDC 24 or FDN 33 Keith talks about Tribal Forest Protection Act Tribe would like to have fruiting shrubs on Leech Lake Reservation. These can’t thrive in a monoculture of red pine Want the whole matrix of a forest, not just a monoculture - recognizing that it’s important to have one foot in reality and one foot in ideology, practice both the science and art of forest management Keith mentions that his bosses aren’t just profit motivated Observe both sides of the road: what do we see that is different in terms of tree species, management? One side of the road is more sparse, lots of blowdown on 1000s of acres here. This is actually more representative of historical forest, more patchy and open. 50% lower canopy On the other side of the road, see younger trees in plantation. Traditional forest management practiced here - easy to grow red pine. Clear cut what was originally there, plant rows of red pine (not natural to have a monoculture like this) Getting sunlight down to the forest floor is a big goal to get more diversity - blueberries like sunlight What species should be out here? Jack pine. Originally fire was an important management factor for this area. Don’t have that disturbance anymore. This site could be the following ecological classification: FDC 24 (central rich dry pine woodland) FDN 33 (northern dry mesic mixed woodland - little more mixed with hardwoods than FDC 24). Historically this was a fire dependent ecological community. Fire return intervals: Catastrophic fires - 200 years All fires - 53 years Fire return interval could be even shorter than 53 years with native contribution (fires used by native people to burn/manage the landscape), potentially on the decade timescale Management recap One side of road: Red pines, 30 year old plantation, some disturbance from heavy equipment (masticating mulcher) as site prep before planting, significant disturbance to soil top. Other side of road: across the road we see 80-85 year old stand of red pine (this is where there was blowdown, more open canopy). Landscape recap What is the sand particle size here? Fine. No coarse fragments. After glacier melted, between Cass Lake and ???? “sand flats” develop This is blanket of finer sand on top with medium toward the bottom. See some lamellae lower in the profile here around 80-90cm. These slow down the water somewhat even though these are sandy soils. Just a little bit of lamellae here Zimmerman soil - lamellic udipsamment Lamellae can have a significant effect on the native plant community , pushing it a little wetter compared to an area without lamellae. Evidence of the masticating mulcher here with a slightly thicker A horizon than you might otherwise see Tree competition See variability in the upper 2 cores due to human disturbance - could almost call this an Ap because of the masticating mulcher 2 upland cores (lamellic udipsamments) A E E/Bt Depression core (Sartell? Typic udipsamment, medium sands) A Bw TFPA Sand Plains Meadows burned during spring Need to open up sites a little more before burning Most folks around here support prescribed burning - understand that it’s an important part of the ecological cycle. These densely planted trees are weak, thin bark, probably wouldn’t survive a fire. Need to think the trees and allow them to age before trying to burn Woodland is defined by 50-75% canopy; Forest is defined by 75-100% canopy closure Emerald ash borer is biggest concern here for invasives Zebra mussels can impact walleye population, an important tribal fod. 5.3 Cuba Hill Mesic Hardwoods (2nd Chippewa Stop) This is a very different site than the one we saw earlier - see more hardwoods, maples and aspens At some point in the past this site was clearcut - approx 60 years ago Conifers mostly absent Aspen was a component of the historical system, but it is even more dominant today after regeneration First lumber barons took big pines. Then they cut down the aspen, paper birch, red oak Upper core (Haplic Glossudalf) : MHN 35 Mesic hardwoods A -Highly organic, fine sandy loam, to 6cm E - Sandy loam, to 30cm Bt - Clay loam, to 105 cm C - Loam, to 130cm, carbonates present Vegetation present: sugar maple, aspen, red maple, red oak, ironwood, mountain maple, birch.

Top horizons here fit into the “loamy mantle” theory Thin loess got mixed in with till below it through tree throw, bioturbation On the Hobbs map we are on the Guthrie Till Plain (brown islands) We are in the ground moraine of the Itasca Moraine How do you distinguish between parent materials?

There is enough of a confining layer to hold water Defining features of a vernal pool: Hold water for six weeks out of the year Less than ¼ acre in size Wet in spring, may be dry in fall No permanent inflow/outflow: precipitation driven See marsh marigolds, rings of ash trees here, range of canopy coverage These are critical habitat for amphibian species! Salamanders and frogs, some endangered species live here With climate change, these areas are vulnerable to droughtiness, high levels of precipitation Other species seen here: black ash, basswood, red maple, yellow birch, willow, horsetail, ostrich ferns, snakeroot, sedges, swamp dewberry, sensitive fern No histic epipedon here - this fits the seasonal nature of the pool. Can’t get much of a core here - too wet. Enough to determine this is an endoaquoll. During dry times, can identify these vernal pools by dry, dark matted leaves present These vernal ponds are important to USFS - there are management restrictions around these seasonally wet features, requirements to have a certain amount of canopy. These areas don’t stand up well to heavy equipement Keegan and Cole (interns) will go out and identify where these seasonal ponds are - eventually make a map. Use LIDAR data and aerial photos to identify &amp; validate up to 85% of seasonal ponds in landscape Ash serves as an important water pump (straw) in these seasonal ponds - but what happens when Emerald Ash Borer arrives?

As the understory gets more mesic, it doesn’t carry the fire as well to create a consistent burn. However, this is a good start 10 sections is where we are - this is an important area to the Leech Lake BAnds. USFS does not harvest in this area 10 section were set aside for tribal importance - in the 2004 forest plan USFS signed with the Leech Lake Band this area was set aside as important Keith advises the tribe on what to do with the big trees when they die, since this area is not being harvested Richer soil here supports bigger trees This site has been burned 2-3 times recently. We see a few Jack Pine mixed in here Fire consumed some litter - charred bowl of tree but not consumed. Young trees are charred a litter, which is good. This helps make them more resilient to fire. Don’t want a thick litter or duff layer in this situation - too much fuel for a potential fire. Would get too hot and kill trees Think about earthworms - they reduce fuel, but also increase nutrient cycling in these systems “Stand replacing fires” - with climate change, can see species 1-2 zones south moving into areas that are burned. This is currently rare in MN, but very common out west These acidic soils are less hospitable to worms. However, as these areas get more mesic, might be friendlier to earthworms Udipsamment here Across the road from the fire FDN 33 Tree species: mountain maple, red maple, sugar maple, birch, red pine, white pine Understory: beaked hazelnut, chokecherry, starflower, early meadow rue, pale bellwort Sands over loamy sands here when we take a deep &gt;2m core When we get &gt;2m down, shifting toward till material (sandy loam) This is mapped as Zimmerman, but we are close to boundary with sand-capped till Underlying till creating a richer environment by holding water up We have sand over till here Cutaway series = sand capped till This is an inclusion in the map unit where till is deeper Tree data: Large white pine (16-18: diameter) - 84-85 years since last major disturbance.

The lagg is ~200m wide here (compare this to ~5m lagg at Marcell) Vegetation: Alder (Tag or Speckled), Alsnus incana subs. rugosa ???, horsetail, marsh marigold Second site ecological type is FPN73 - forested peatland. This is the richer of 2 peatland types. The other type is AP (acidic peatland), which is more nutrient-poor. Core 2 Humaquept (FPN 73) 0-30cm Fibric to hemic material 30cm + Saturated mineral material Q. How is this humaquept different from the endoaquept we just saw? A. Here we see organics present, and a thicker gravelly sand layer. We are down-drainage from the endoaqupet and see higher water here. Historically this may have been an active beach - explains thick coarse gravelly sand layer. Core 3 (APN 80) We saw an abrupt transition while walking the path - start to see sphagnum, black spruce, tamarack, cranberry, cotton grass, bog laurel APN 80 defined by 25% canopy above 5m tall trees. APN 90 would be more open with stunted trees Q. Why do we see more tree canopy here? A. We have been walking up in elevation on bog - more acid here means that decomposition is slower, trees can get their shallow roots out of the saturated zone. Think of this as a landscape scale version of the smaller Marcell peatland. This area is predominantly rainfed, water flows toward lagg, not toward bog. Could see radiating pattern on satellite photos because of the shape of the bog dome Core 4 (FDN 43) - this is back in the woods on a mineral island, we spent a while looking for a relatively undisturbed point on the mineral island. Looking for the psamment in our catena. We are on a high point - see bush honeysuckle.

Not a true bog because of density of alder and black spruce. This would be considered a “rich black spruce swamp” Water tracks - can see where water moves through the peatlands in infrared photos. Find richer species in the water tracks. Water in contact with underlying mineral material creates richer conditions, more diverse species 4- less bog birch and alter than #3, thinner and smaller trees. Transition to APN 81. When we see the alder and bog birch disappear, we will know that we have transitioned to APN 80. 5- Old drainage ditch on section line and edge effect - significant opening in the trees.

Works with 25-35 farms throughout the year. Checks fields, scouts, helps coordinate harvest Joe: Agronomy manager. Comments that soil and climate are great in RR Valley for sugar beets. Can store beets 8.5 months out of the year here! Tyler: General agronomist. Works with growers, government, allied companies (pesticide, fertilizer, etc.) Notes the Ag Intern program, opportunities posted in midwinter on the Crystal Sugar website if students are interested Ryan - intern John - agronomist Crystal Sugar is a cooperative - owned by growers. About sugar beets Beets are in the ground 4.5 months, stored for 7.5-8 months out of the year Sugar beets are 75% water - making sugar is about getting rid of this water! Largest harvest Crystal Sugar has had is 12 million tons, harvested from 400,000 acres Sugar content is ~18% in beets Rotation is 2-3 years between beet crops. Typically would have soybeans - corn - barley - wheat. Occasionally sunflowers or potatoes thrown in the mix N drives yield and quality. Too much N means high yield but low sugar. Need the right balance. Goal is 130 lbs available N per acre Beets planted in 22 inch rows, 4.75 inch spacing. 60,000 beets per acre Beet tap roots go down 6 feet, lateral roots go down to 10 feet. Beets drill deep for nutrients and water Seeds grown in the Willamette Valley (hybridized seed). Aren’t many producers of hybrid sugar beet seed Beets are an indeterminate crop - they grow until harvest Nice stable price for sugar - to make more money, they need to increase production and become more efficient In the last 20 years, they have decreased average land planted while maintaining total tons harvested without increasing input costs -- discussion about this being a form of sustainability Between 2003 and today, harvests have increased from 6,000 lb beets per acre to 10,000 lb beets per acre [fact check this with one of the Crystal Sugar folks] NDSU and UMN are known for sugar beet research Polk County MN produces the most beets in the US! Beets are a $1.1 million / acre commodity Question about staggered planting - does Crystal Sugar aim for that? Not really - want beets to be in the ground as many days as possible. They can germinate at 38F. As soon as soil can carry tractors they want farmers out prepping seedbeds and planting The reason pre-harvest starts in July is because they have to move a certain amount of beets through processing quickly because they can’t be stored in the hot weather. By October 1, crew of 13,000 people running around the region harvesting and storing beets before ground freezes. Their goal is to do a mass harvest all within 10 days. Comment from one of the CS folks “Soils are the biggest black box in agronomy” Challenges During winter - shelter belts and tree rows collect lots of snow out here. This can have a major economic impact on farmers who want to get in their fields. Trend they are seeing is people actually removing shelter belts. One of the CS agronomists claims that shelter belts are also competing with beets for resources? Shift to growing cover crops with beets instead of using shelter belts 40% of growers are using some kind of cover crop during the season Crystal Sugar has 100% Roundup Ready sugar beet production - cover crops terminated chemically. One risk with cover crops - after they are terminated, residue can increase the albedo on the field, drop soil temp and slow down the beets Another issue is resistant weeds - water hemp, common ragweed, kosha (?) Diseases that affect beets: Rhizoctonia, Circomspra ?? Insect pests: cutworms, wireworm springtails, sugar beet root maggot Pesticide toolbox for beets is very small. Also, sugarbeets are a relatively small commodity, so pesticide producers are not incentivized to produce additional formulations Very proactive and targeted with pesticide applications. Pick right time and place to address specific issues if needed. Issues of pesticide drift - Crystal Sugar’s contracts allow staff to walk onto any field in the company to monitor for drift. If it is found, they quarantine the area. Bring in a third party to check for off-label pesticides. If the area is contaminated, the crop must be destroyed. Can’t risk taking those beets to processing. Careful conflict management required in these situations! 75% of beets are planted on previous wheat ground. Easier to till broadleaf weeds out of a small grain. Being able to grow wheat in the rotation is important. Staff members sometimes have to make hard decisions when working with farmers - rejecting a load of beets if quality is poor Sugar market &amp; products United Sugars actually sells the sugar for Crystal. Crystal has 30-40% of the beet sugar market. Lots of their product is sold bulk to companies like General Mills, Pepsi, Hershey, Lifesaver, Jello. General Mills is the largest purchaser of sugar in the US. They package 45 other labels (in addition to Crystal Sugar). Other companies ship labels up here so their sugar can be branded. Produce powdered, granulated, and liquid sugar Beet pulp and molasses are sold to Midwest Agrci-commodities. Used for cattle feed and dog feed and “Betain” for poultry. The Triple Crown (horse?) winner last year was fed on beet pulp and tailings About filtering and cleaning sugar - when the product is finished, they have 99.998% pure sucrose. They refine a very clear product Sugar consumption has levelled off, even increased Brazil is driving GMO sugar cane production. Previously it was GMO beet production competing with conventional (non-GMO) sugar cane Max acreage CS has grown : 512,000 at peak producing 10 million tons Now they are at less than 400,000 acres, but producing 12 million tons Corn syrup hasn’t been as much competition recently - consumer perception of corn syrup is falling. About soils in this field (Redi Site) ~4% organic matter pH 7.9-8.4 Montmorillonite clay less than 0.5% sugarbeets mechanically irrigated here - “100% irrigated from the ground up” Fields have been graded to drain into ditches. This topography we see is not natural. The natural topography you see here is drop of ~1ft PER MILE! * We see a barley cover crop on this (Redi Site) field. Some farmers do rye or wheat, but 90% plant barley * Get into fields - finding silty clay (~42%) over silty clay (50+%). Calcic epiaquert. * 200-250 feet of clay here. These are smectitic soils, predominant mineralogy is shrink/swell clays This is an epiaquert or epiaquoll Ap? -Silty clay, &gt;35% clay, 10YR 5/2, cracks Bg - Silty clay 50+% clay 2.5Y 4/2 Q. Less reduction than you would expect based on the fine texture here -- why? A. Greyest part of the soil is 20-40cm, zone of most intense (epi)saturation. See carbonates all the way to the surface here. Almost all of the soils in this landscape will effervesce to the surface due to high evaporative demand and capillary rise. Only place where you don’t have carbonates at surface is in a depression. More evaporation occurs from ag managed land compared to prairie - this draws the carbonate up over decades Lab data from county soil surveys shows that soil goes from 5-10% carbonates at the surface, as high as 20-30%, and then drops back to ~15% These A horizons [in the field] are thinner than we’d expect to find in an undisturbed area due to wind erosion (technically don’t have a mollic epipedon here) Note about soil taxonomy &amp; carbonates: If depth to carbonates is greater than or equal to 75cm, need &gt;25cm mollic colors to make mollic If depth to carbonates is less than or equal to 75cm, sliding scale to make mollic - here we only need 18cm to make mollic Need water evaporation to get carbonate deposition. Some carbonate rich water ends up sitting in the zone of saturation. When the drier time of year arrives, the water evaporates and deposits the carbonate. This zone of carbonate is analogous to argillic horizons where we see a bump in clay content These are some of the highest pH soils in the state! To get above 8.5 pH, need not only carbonate, but also sodium carbonate. Ca ties up P at high pHs -- P availability problem! To overcome this, Crystal Sugar puts 12 lbs P in furrow with seed when planting In the 1990s saw more chisel plows in the fall. Historically alot of moldboard plow, but now many growers are transitioning to vertical till (super coulters). Having Round-up Ready crops allows vertical tillage to work in this management situation. Before Round-up Ready beets were available, farmers had to come in with a cultivator to cut weeds before planting What is the average year for growing sugar beets with Crystal Sugar? January: signing contracts with growers. Each staff member works with ~9 farms, 20,000 acres. Work to educate farmers on best practices for diseases, insects, weeds. The farms they work with are generational farms. Crystal Sugar staff is 90% CCA certified, which means they complete ~20 hours university training per year May-June: Planting, measure stands and evaluate pesticide &amp; fertility needs. July-September: In mid-August harvest starts, beets go to factory to be processed over the course of 3-4 days Oct 1: first stockpile harvests. Beets get piled up, can last 14-100 days depending on the weather. There are 105 pilers across the valley. 12 have sheds where the beets get frozen from the ground up Beets as biological dynamite: with sugar content ~18%, beets that are piled up can be dangerous. Need to be careful when they are piled in big piles. Staff uses infrared image flights, drones to find hotspots in the beet piles. There are staff members on call 24/7 for reloading 8.2 2nd Stop w/ Crystal Sugar Calciaquoll A - Silty clay loam, 10YR 3/1, slight effervescence Bkg1 - Silty clay, 7.5YR 5/1, strong/violent effervescence Bkg2 - Silty clay loam, 2.5Y 5/2 Cs - 2.5Y 4/3 Second group takes a core from a depression: Thicker A horizon, more poorly drained (seeing more reduced colors) Textures are silty clay loams over silt loams Compared to our first stop (Redi site) this soil tends to blow more because of the silt. Brock says this farmer may have done a cover crop - see some residue on the surface We hit frozen soil while augering - why? Heat is transferred into the soil when particles are well-connected. Sands have least poor space, so they transmit heat first. More clay means more pore space, better insulated. These soils hold frost longer compared to sandier soils 8.3 3rd Stop w/ Crystal Sugar Seeing very fine sandy loams at the surface (eolian sands) with silt loams and silty clay loams below Talf = landform term for an area outside of a depression 2 modes of deposition: Silty clay loams at the bottom of these cores are probably lacustrine Surface sandy horizons deposited by near-shore processes or in shallow water. Parent material here shows transition from true lacustrine materials to near-shore. On the other end of the spectrum, would see water-worked till Management on this site - little higher tonnage (yield) from these soils compared to the 2 fields we’ve seen earlier today. Growers on these sandy soils use a little less N because the plant roots can go deeper in this soil to find N. More erosion control practices are also needed on this soil Plant shallower because water is more likely to wick up to surface. This ground is much more forgiving when wet compared to the higher clay soils we saw earlier today. Can still get out and harvest if it’s a little wet. We are just a couple miles from the sites earlier today but the farming practices are VERY different to manage this soil (Hwy 75 as a a divider for these 2 types of soils) One drawback on these soils - if get too saturated or wet, soil can lose all cohesiveness (thixotropic behavior). Can easily lose a tractor in these situations Slickensides definition: feature on ped exteriors in smectitic clays that swell and rub to create smooth spots. Horizon suffix for slickensides is ss Because we don’t see big surface cracks here and we have less than 35% clay in upper 18cm, these are NOT vertisols. These are calciudolls Depression: cumulic calciudoll Talf: typic calciudoll 8.4 4th stop w/ Crystal Sugar This is the field where some areas the beet leaves all lie flat during parts of the summer Surface textures here are silty clay loams , but If we find the right spot in this field, should hit some sandier material down deeper Off in the distance we see an overhead sprinkler on a different field - more evidence that something is different on this site compared to the others Don’t really have a good soil series component set up for these situations Aerial imagery of the beet crop during the right part of the season (driest) might be able to map these strands in the field Beets rely heavily on the stored water in the profile - fine sands reduce plant available water in rooting zone "],

Nic will send them in for testing: P,K, OM, pH, S L201A I370B L83A 423 1370B 1355B Nic references MN Geological Survey gridded maps of elemental variability in the subsoil. Class looks at the drainage ditch near Brad’s alfalfa fields. Observe how deep the ditchere here have to be to get water to drain. In most fields tile lines are ~3 feet deep according to Brad Most of this Des Moines Till landscape is tile drained Conversation with Brad Brad and his family are cropping livestock farmers They have 1000 ewes and grow all feed for them. Manure goes back on the field. They work 1000 acres This is “high alkali” land. When Brad was born, this land was covered in cattail sloughs Now, the only cattail sloughs remaining are on his home farm - about 10 acres total. Brad likes to see wildlife there, he is proud of it and protecting it Comments that he is probably the last moldboard plower in the township For Brad, a big part of the decision to farm the way he does is economics. 1000 acres is not enough to support 2 families (Brad and his son farm together). Also can’t afford to spend lots of $ on new equipment for conservation tillage It takes skill to do moldboard plow right Some of the benefits of moldboard plowing are: helps soil warm up and deals with weed issues He has tried no till south of his driveway for 2 years - resulted in big thistle patches Have incorporated some cover crops - mainly because of the advantage they provide for grazing sheep. Has neighbors doing cover crops without livestock, and those neighbors have limited success. Brad thinks that we are too far north in MN for cover crops to work very well. Sees poor stands at neighbors, and some have invested in expense equipment Brad has had issues with cover crops plugging tile lines. This is frustrating and expensive to fix. Root hairs hit the tile line, find oxygen and explode in growth. Find big “brillo pads” of roots in the lines Mix that plugged the lines: 3 lb radish / 3 lb turnip / 1 bu oats Mix that hasn’t plugged the lines: 1 lb radish / 2 lb dwarf Essex rape Typically seeds CCs last week of July, tries to time the maturity of species with peak nutritional value for sheep. Mainly use these CCs to flush * Ewes with nutrients at ovulation. His lamb crop has exploded since he started doing this 7 years ago - increased 170-200% ! Lets ewes graze out the cover crop until January when they can’t find it under the snow. Brings up the “nutrition plane” ? and length of grazing with cover crops When he was breeding Aug - October, pastures are typically declining in nutritional value. CCs help fix this The Farm Business Sheep are a big part of their income. Cropping is more of a sideline. It’s difficult to earn a living farming. Keeps the amount of land he has to have consistent feed for his sheep and place to put the manure. Using manure on the fields saves them $75/acre, but they have to rent manure trucks to take the manure to their fields further out In 1992 hired crop consultant to test ground at the home farm. Won’t have to add fertility to his home fields for the rest of his career! * * * * History of putting manure on the fields (for 20 years), nutrient levels are very high Brad and his son lamb 1000 ewes each year, and buy 3000-5000 lambs per year to finish for market Sells lamb directly to slaughterhouse in CO. When Brad was 25, he had 5 choices for slaughterhouses within 500 miles. Now he has to go to CO with his lambs Has considered direct marketing lamb, but it would be difficult to do at scale. Typically people who are direct marketing have a small number of animals and primary income coming from off-farm. Cost of seed Brad has been a loyal customer of Pioneer Corn for many years, but they were purchased by another company - comments that it’s almost like we don’t have anti-trust laws anymore! Now seed is $396 a bag. 1 bag covers 2.6 acres Farm margins keep getting thinner and thinner. When son Dusty came home and wanted to farm, Brad saw two options: More sheep Fight with neighbors for more land “Sheep are not easily automated. That creates opportunity. Automation takes little independent guys out of it.” ~Brad Meyers Why did Brad pick sheep specifically? Did a sheep 4H project when he was 10 years old. Fell in love with them. Learned everything he knows from other people and the school of hard knocks Lambs aren’t traded on Chicago Mercantile. Keeps investors from trading his product and trading profits out before the lambs even reach market weight “The day they start trading lambs on the board, I quit. Our market is true supply and demand. That’s what has happened to the cattle and hog industry, those folks have become slaves, slave labor.” ~Brad Meyers Brad has had 3 bankers scorn him for sticking with sheep. “I view a laugh as a stroke of opportunity. When people laugh and don’t do what you do, that’s an opportunity.” ~Brad Meyers How does sheep manure compare to other manure on the market? Coyotes Coyotes have been one of his biggest challenges. Story about paying someone else to trap coyotes for $50 each, and Brad ended up writing a check for 3,000. Coyote population has been growing - losing 10s of ewes in 2 months on some pastures. First he tried donkeys, then livestock guardian dogs (Great Pyrenees). Dogs were close to 100% effective, but some of his neighbors got angry when dogs would escape and end up on their property - threaten to shoot the dogs. Brad loses $250 each time he loses a ewe. He does carry insurance on the animals, but it’s hard to afford &gt;$1,000 deductible each time 6 ton yield calculation - Brad wants this worked into soil testing so he knows whether to fertilize after first ??? Buffer Law Buffer law - 125,000 acres of cropland lost in 2 neighboring counties to the buffer Still have to pay taxes on that land! Brad points out how ditch banks are shaped - is there really runoff when the bank is sloped away from the ditch? Brad agrees that some spots might need a buffer, but not everywhere as a blanket Brad is very careful with his practices to protect water quality - stays 300 feet from tile intake with his manure spreader, spreads in the fall and tills it in. Gully on the neighbor’s property - Was fixed and now it’s becoming a problem again (we’ll see this later today) Reinstalled tile deeper, filled in gully with more clay, put in fabric every so often to curb erosion Catena @ Brad’s Farm Texture are loams and silty clay loams 10YR / 2.5 Y See shale fragments in Des Moines Lobe Till ground moraine Carbonates to surface at the summit position - under natural conditions, we would expect to see carbonates deeper at the summit because water infiltrates here Tillage erosion most effective on summit and shoulder - after 150 years of erosion we see parent material at the surface. Summit: hapludoll Backslope: inceptisol / Vess Vess series is mapped in this area on eroded knolls (and throughout the state). Classified as an inceptisol, but is actually an eroded mollisol Depression: Webster series. No carbonate in profile. Historically this would have been a wet meadow. In dry times of year, water moves from the depression out to the edges via capillary action. We see carbonates here in a ring ~30 feet from the depression 9.3 Grant &amp; Dawn Breitkreutz When started farming 22 years ago, they were doing full-width tillage and it wasn’t working financially They have a cow-calf operation, custom finish other cattle. Years ago, they started to run out of feed for their mama cows - this is when they started studying grass management Important influences on Grant/Dawn’s thinking: Ian Mitchell (?) from South Africa (mob grazing?) Gabe Brown Ray Archuleta Allen Williams Burleigh County, ND - innovations in cover crops. Relay cropping, no-till. Manokin Farm? David Brandt (OH): developed 24-48 inches of black dirt on his farm, had a soil named after him. From Ohio. Developed 24-48 inches of black dirt on his farms Management Changes Within 7 years of starting new practices, they had quadrupled grass production and reduced herbicides and pesticides on grazing land (check this not sure what the 7 years applies to or if it’s correct) In 1998 Grant and Dawn bought their first no-till drill They knew the practices were really working when they got 1.75 inches of rain and still had the hay cut within 6 hours of the rain 2007 they started doing no-till small grains Were hesitant to switch to no till corn because they though they needed expensive equipment When tilling, they used to pick lots of rocks Now they are 100% no-till. Put in cover crop while crop is growing or immediately after harvest. * High priority to keep a living root in the soil all the time Plant corn, after 2-3 weeks they interseed cover crops into the planted corn. Cereal rye is their go-to cover crop, vetch is another important one for them. In their rotation they do Corn - Soy - Small grains, hay included in rotation sometimes too Their cover crop species mix changes depending on the conditions, season, state of the land. They notice that their soil biology breaks down cover crops so quickly; residue doesn’t stick around very long Mention that the animals are a key part of the operation and contribute to soil health, but it’s currently hard to quantify that. Rick Haney &amp; Lance Gunderson (Ward Labs) are working on that. Grant comments that mycorrhizal fungi are very important for soil health Grant and Dawn run cows across every acre at least once per year. Cows add important biology to the soil! They need flexibility in their operation to respond to the seasonal conditions and changes. Keep records of where they graze and what they plan on all their acres. Typically with managed grazing the cows are getting moved every 1-3 days. Grant and Dawn use earthworms as a soil health indicator. They have calculated that they have 1 million per acre on their cropland and 850,000 per acre on their managed pasture. They no longer worm their cattle because they don’t want to kill the worms out in the pasture! In pastures they are constantly seeing an increase in species and composition of pasture plants. Also many different birds &amp; wildlife Grant mentions “Farmers Footprint” documentary series - Grant and Dawn featured in this. https://farmersfootprint.us/ Have reduced inputs to almost nothing but still get 160-240 bushels corn in yield Having 3-4 crops in the rotation has broken the insect cycle so they aren’t experiences the same levels of insect pests. Have not sprayed insecticide in 6 years, no fungicide sprayed in 8 years Herbicide use cut in half, applying only 10% of the fertility they used to They have a great predatory insect population now that they have stopped spraying. Grant comments that it would be a slower process to transition to this type of system (100% no till, cover crops, drastically reduced inputs) without cows. The cows are an essential part of the system for them Grant and Dawn have not experienced a yield drag on their cash grain crops ; they believe others who only do 2 crops in their rotation, and don’t include animals would experience a yield drag Grant thinks you can see a big impact on the soil health in 1 year with cows, but it would take 3-5 years without cows Grant and Dawn are currently trying to rehabilitate some DNR land across the river - they can’t put cows on it (because of DNR rules) so they have been using cover crops on it. This is their 5th year growing cover crops on it Last 3 years have been very wet. Grant reports rain during growing season: Last year: 44 inches 2 years ago: 41 inches 3 years ago: 36 inches Have noticed an incredible increase in water infiltration rate - Grant claims they can infiltrate 30-50 inches per day now on some of their land. Markets &amp; economics A key part of making sustainable farming work is making sure there are markets opening up that reward farmers for doing these practices, diversifying their operations. At this point, the end processors (General Mills, Land O Lakes) are approaching farmers directly because there is a consumer demand for sustainability they want to fill. Gabe Brown has developed some soil health criteria for General Mills -- but Grant and Dawn don’t feel restricted by this criteria. Grant comments that 85-90% of the input purchases that farmers make are directly dictated by what their input suppliers tell them; important for folks to think for themselves about their needs Another economic challenge to diversifying farm systems is that there are (currently) a limited number of insurable crops: corn, soy, sugar beets. Loan officers resistant to supporting alternative types of farming systems Big picture -- the agricultural system is currently focused on PRODUCTION. Grant advocates that everyone should be focused on NET PROFIT. Grant and Dawn have observed that soil erosion has magnified since they started farming ; they can look at their neighbors’ fields after a 1 inch rain (falling over 3 hours) and see standing water. * * However on G &amp; D’s land, springs are starting to form again on their hills G &amp; D don’t have to worry so much about trafficability and compaction anymore - their soil has the structure Comparing where we are on a little hill at G&amp;D’s farm, the structure and color of the soil are very different. Here we see darker color, more aggregation. 9.4 Back at Brad’s Ditch &amp; Field Class observes tile drain running after a brief rainfaill Buffers don’t protect N or P in a watershed that is tile-drained (like SW MN) land use patterns are too complex for a silver bullet solution like buffers to be advocated everywhere -- there are multiple ways to get sediment into rivers and streams, need to think about which mechanisms are relevant in a given place For the MN River, bank erosion contributes a significant amount of sediment In this region, tile drainage conveys nitrate out into waterways UMN does lots of research in this area - Jeff Strock at Lamberton is investigating how long the tiles flow each year Class observes the surface intake (vertical pipe) in Brad’s field. These are usually placed in depressions where you would historically have ponding. Sediment can travel down through these intakes and be transported through the tile lines, sometimes carrying P with it. The soil we are observing here in the depression in Brad’s field is a typical Webster. No effervescence along the surface within the depression radius. You do see effervescence in a ring around the depression 9.5 Gully on neighbor’s land Class observes a gully on a neighbor’s land. Recent attempts were made to repair the gully; silt fence is visible. However, continued erosion has already overwhelmed these efforts and the gully seems to be opening again. Tile drainage is visible on the surface here where it has been exposed/ripped up. For the last 2 years, this gully was almost as deep as Nic is tall! Class looks at the “nick point” ; this is where headward erosion of the gully takes place This land is leased to Brad’s neighbors who farm lots of acres; Brad thinks this should have been maintained as a grassed waterway the whole time. Perennial cover would help stabilize the soil here Landowners now have contract with the NRCS to fix this gully Gullies can generate huge amounts of sediments in a short period of time; some studies show that “hotspots” on the landscape like gullies contribute lots of sediment to local waterways 9.6 Brad’s Cattail Slough (MRP 83 - Prairie Mixed Cattail Marsh) This is one of the biggest undrained wetlands in this and surrounding counties. It is a pothole wetland. Brad is quite proud of it. In native states, the small depression we saw drained in fields would have looked like this Reed canary grass present. It is listed as both an invasive species AND an important grazing species In terms of moisture level, pothole wetlands &gt; wet prairie &gt; mesic prairie As you get to the mesic prairie areas you would see Canisteo soil present "],

It was established in 1957 and features 650 acres total 500 acres are in corn and soy production. These crops fund the center Researchers from UMN can pay $275/acre to use research plot land here This ROC serves the 14 county area and has 3 tenure track faculty: Jeff Strock Paolo Pagliari Axel Garcia Variable input crop Management (VICM) areas - native grasses established here in 1991 Elwell Agroecology Farm - gifted to the U, majority of organic research acres are here. 10.2 SWROC Tour with Andy Andry will walk around with us and talk about the research at SWROC. Overview of topics he will cover: 6 paired wetlands Paired ditches Bioreactor site Cropping systems - camelina SWROC Wetlands These systems are in radio communication -- maintenance is key! They have a surface flow wetland, vertical flow wetland, and horizontal flow wetland The vertical flow wetland has tile drainage underneath, water percolates down through the profile and collects in the tile The horizontal flow wetland has a layer of rocks underneath the wetland - bacteria grow on these rocks With these wetlands, the main goal is to treat nitrate and P. When you retain water, you can get some reductions. However, retained water quickly becomes a reduced system... P is tied up with Fe3+. However, in a reduced system Fe3+ -&gt; Fe2+, and P is released! So although you are reducing nitrate through denitrification in a reduced system, your P levels might be going up. This is a challenge! MN State Nutrient Reduction Strategy outlines reductions in N and P going forward into the future using 1980-1996 avg values as the baseline. There have been some maintenance issues with the wetland systems in previous years; fixing for future so they can continue the comparison study. Think about MN’s natural landscape before agriculture and development - on the Des Moines Lobe landscape, we have lost more than 90% of the wetlands that were originally here! Jay Bell has done research on this issue. What are the water quality solutions that are available for this part of the state (with lots of tile drainage)? Buffer strips probably not the best option Here we want to think about edge-of-field technology SWROC Bioreactor The first generation of the bioreactor project involved digging a trench and filling it with wood chips or other substrates. Tile drainage is directed to these ditches and water is analyzed after it moves through the ditches to test N levels. The nice thing about this system is that no maintenance is needed after installation; only problem is that not every field has space Ditches are not currently listed as a BMP in the MN Nutrient Reduction Strategy The second generation bioreactors are more like cubes filled with layers of different substrates (wood chips or corn stalks) to create a more vertical system. The system we are looking at has corn cobs on top, then wood chips, and finally red rock (where bacteria can grow). The 1st and 2nd gen systems have different hydraulic residence times. Researchers are trying to figure out how long the water needs to spend on the bed for the N removal to be effective. The 2nd gen system achieves the same amount of N reduction in eighth the time time (cut down from 24 hours to 3 hours). To address P, SWROC looking at whether steel slag, crushed concrete, or limestone could adsorb P. * They have experimented with different combinations of systems to remove P and N over the last several years Because you are relying on bacteria to do this work, temperature of water makes a big difference! In June when the water temp increases, the bacteria can reduce more and faster. However, the biggest flux of nutrients actually happens earlier - when the snow is melting. They have tried adding heating tapes to the systems to help the microbes during April &amp; May These systems can reduce nitrate 30%+, and with heat can reduce N load 42%. In the first year these systems reduced P 52%, seemed very promising. However cold temperatures in the next year resulted in a P increase (P released) Andry says the future is microbiology. The key is to select strains of bacteria that can perform under real conditions. This is where the research need is right now. Satoshi Ishii (SWAC) and Emily Anderson (Masters student) worked on some of the microbiology in these systems Question - is it possible to recover some of the P from the system? Andry says this is a good idea, they have imagined spreading wood chips across a field after they had been used in the bioreactor How many days is the drain tile flowing around here? In wet years it’s from April to August, and can start flowing again later in the fall. SWROC Camelina Fields Camelina is a cold-hardy oil seed crop with 38-42% oil SWROC has split plot fields, 3 with camelina and 3 without Researchers hope that camelina will scavenge extra nitrate in the fall and spring before a typical crop will grow. At one point the US Navy was considering camelina for biofuel Costs per lb of N removed with different methods (see 2013 publication online referenced by Andry for full report - can also email him for this) Cover crops - $25 Controlled drainage - $0.91 Bioreactors - $0.95 Constructed wetlands $1.32 Saturated buffers - $1.22 10.2.1 Catena @ SWROC Summit - textures are loam over silt loam over loamy sands. This is Des Moines Lobe Till. Carbonates at 110cm. Typic Hapludoll Ap A BA Bw Bk C Lower Backslope - Carbonates at 80cm, Aquic Hapludoll Ap A Bw Bgk Cgk Footslope - Gypsum present here! Typic Calciaquoll. Suffix for gypsum is “y”. Gypsic horizon must have &gt;5% gypsum by weight. Carbonates here at 40cm Ap A Ak Bgy Toeslope - Formed in local colluvium over till. No carbonates at 160+cm. Cumulic endoaquoll Ap A Cg To get gypsum, need overall dry climate or semi-arid. Here in (wet) MN, need exactly the right landform and geology to get gypsum. Hydrology shifts salts like we have seen, even subtle topography/landforms can have a big impact on hydrology Class goes to nearby kame/esker and takes a core - sandy loams over medium sands This is a big sand pile! It’s a kame, similar to the landform that Borlaug Hall sits on. A kame is an area on an ice sheet where the was a crevasse or waterfall. Ice melts and water carries away silts and clays, leaves sand. Ice walled lakes result in a pile of finer lacustrine clay 10.3 Highwater Ethanol Plant Introduction to Highwater Ethanol Highwater has been in operation for 10 years now. It is a 60 million gallon facility They get runoff water from a quarry, it is piped in from 20 miles away. Use 125 million gallons of water a year They have 2 production wells, but they only pump approx every 4 years Byproducts of ethanol production include dried distiller’s grain (can be used for cattle feed) and corn oil (can be used for biodiesel) They use 21 million bushel of ground corn each year Redwood County produces 50 million bushels of corn each year - this county is the second largest corn producer in the state of MN Their ethanol is shipped to the east coast or down to Atlanta GA Why is ethanol important? Traces the history of smog in the 1970s -1980s, with adoption of 10% ethanol in 1980s-1990s, air problems decreased Ethanol works as a fuel because you get more energy produced from 1 gallon than it takes to make 1 gallon. Get 2.97 gallons ethanol out of 1 bushel of corn - efficiency is increasing! 10 years ago they got 2.85 gal / bu corn, and 20 years ago it was 2.7 gal / bu corn. They achieve this efficiency through better yeast and enzymes Revenues $90-150 million, sell the product at $1.15-$1.50 /gal. They have been profitable 7 out of the last 10 years Costs: $350,000-$500,000 on natural gas, $250,000-$300,000 on electricity They get their corn from within a 30 mile radius and ship the byproduct ground corn within a 100 mile radius for livestock feed The EPA approved E15 fuel for year-round use on June 1 this year The oil industry can actually increase their margin by blending in ethanol because the ethanol price per gallon is lower than the price of gasoline. Currently there is a conversation about doing a more detailed life cycle analysis of ethanol for a “low carbon fuel standard” that would evaluate the energy inputs of fertilizer, tractor fuel, etc that goes into producing corn and ethanol. In Brazil, they use 100% ethanol in transportation fuels 141 billion gallons of fuel are used per year - 15 billion gallons of ethanol are produced each year Tour in Ethanol Plant Class walks through ethanol plant to observe the process Trucks weigh in and out with their load - 1000 bu of corn per truck, 60-120 trucks received per day. HE buys corn from farmers directly and from local co-ops. They have 1.8 million bushels of storage capacity for corn on site. They are producing ethanol in the winter too - water usage goes down during this time because it’s easier to cool the product in the middle of the process Ethanol is shipped on train cars - 28,800 gallons per train car, and 8-12 train cars loaded per day HE employs 43 full time employees Water is treated by reverse osmosis Federal regulations require the denaturing of ethanol before shipping (so no one can drink it) HE runs 24 hours a day, 360 days a year. They shut down the other 5 days of the year for maintenance. Process for making ethanol Grind corn Separate out water and oil Once oil gone, corn mash and water are mixed Enzymes and yeasts are mixed in Class visits the lab where they do analysis of the corn and products from different stages in the process - every step along the way One quality parameter is that ethanol can’t be sold with &gt;1.26% water Biggest technical challenge for HE is making sure the ingredients are always ready and right. * * * Everyone needs to work and run the plant in an identical way so the process is consistent. The biggest challenge for the industry is low ethanol prices right now. Many states in the US don’t have infrastructure (stations) to have E15 fuel China’s ethanol tariffs were 20% 1.5 years ago, but risen to 65-70% recently 10.4 Sakatah Lake State Park (MHS 49) We are transitioning back from prairie to forest - this is the tension zone Central Des Moines Lobe has a slow rolling ground moraine Here we are seeing a stagnation moraine. Hummocky terrain formed by glacier advance and retreat. Well-defined hills and depressions Owatonna is on a lateral moraine of the Des Moines Lobe (where ice ended ) 300,000-500,000 years ago, till from pre-Wisconsin glaciation is deposited. This is a different age than everything we have seen so far Comparison between Des Moines Lobe landscape (internally drained) and Driftless/unglaciated (externally drained) In DLT landscape, not many surface water bodies (like rivers and streams) In Driftless, wetlands are only in floodplains and river valleys This older glaciated landscape is called the “Iowan Erosion Surface” Loess is found in places where there was no ice cover during the last glaciation Topography here in Driftless is controlled by the BEDROCK. Compare this with the majority of the state where topography is controlled by glacial sediment What are parent materials like in an unglaciated landscape? Uplands: residuum Footslopes: colluvium River valleys: Alluvium Bedrock: Sandstone, limestone, sedimentary "],
["day-10-the-driftless-i.html", "Chapter 11 Day 10: The Driftless I 11.1 Featherstone Farm 11.2 2 cores from neighbor’s field (near Featherstone Farm)", " Chapter 11 Day 10: The Driftless I 6/6/19 11.1 Featherstone Farm (Jack Hadine (sp?)) Intro to Featherstone Jack has been farming for a long time in many different places - he runs an organic fresh market vegetable farm, manages ~230 acres. 130-140 acres of annual veg each year. 75% of this land is in the valley (best soils), and ¼ is on the ridge (basically farming clay subsoil but better drained) Need to have the soil /microclimate/aspect line up in order to create a viable agricultural system Production - 300 summer CSA shares, 500 winter CSA shares, 10 months out of year wholesale production Jack likes the idea of feeding LOTS of people locally In Dec, Jack purchased 22 adjacent acres to his building at agricultural value FF moved to this site in 2008 Management Decisions and Changes Featherstone is a the beginning of their “high tunnel production era” - allows for more consistent production, some control over conditions compared to outside. In the next 3-6 years the plan is to have an area of 250’ x 250’ under plastic with gutters connecting the high tunnels. High tunnels have much greater yields than growing outside - see increase of 12-15x yield for peppers and tomatoes in the high tunnel From a production standpoint, Jack feels he has more in common with conventional vegetable producers than with organic dairy or meat farmers Jack and his crew manage many succession plantings of fresh market crops to meet wholesale demand - for example, he will have 8 plantings of broccoli across 2 acres in order to provide 2 consistent months of broccoli in Sep-Oct. Need to produce 500 cs/week for wholesale customers. He is competing with the Central Valley in CA where 90% of the broccoli in this country is grown Across the farm there are large variations in soil, drainage, wind that impact how the different crops are grown Difference between hoophouse and greenhouse: greenhouse is heated, controlled environment. High tunnel/hoophouse is not heated, but it is protected. The larger the covered area under plastic, the greater the effectiveness because there is less edge effect - this is driving his goal to have a large area under plastic Climate change and sustainability One climate adoption irony - the volatile weather is driving the use of plastic mulch and high tunnels as a way to stay sustainable (as a business) Jack tried “sustainability” in the form of solar panels about 9 years ago, and nearly went broke trying to pursue that route. Now he thinks in terms of climate adaptability Rainfall is another challenge; seeing more intense rain, more wet periods. This causes disease issues for the plants. Jack is seeing lots of changes in climate in a very short time period Challenges * Climate change, weather variability (see above) * Labor is big challenge for the farm - they are trying to use machines as much as possible. * Land tenure another big challenge - trying to increase production on his owned land to buffer volatility if he loses a lease on the other land. Jack’s first land cost $400/acre. Where we are now cost $9,000/acre. Good soil is key for successful farming What makes this particular site special from a soil standpoint? He feels he went from a D- vegetable site at his old place to A+ here. The soil makes a HUGE difference! We are in a unique area from a natural history and soil standpoint. We are standing in a classic floodplain here - at one point river would have flooded up this far, renewing the soil. We are in the “X” of ancient oxbow where soils were laid down for millenia by the river Black silt loam, high organic matter soils grow delicious veggies! That’s the magic -- and since the silt loam is laid down on sand, they still get decent drainage, ability to get in fields to work just a few days after rain It’s very important to preserve the best agricultural land - not build over soil like this that is ideal for food production This land was originally zoned commercial in Rushford Village. Was very difficult to purchase it at agricultural value. Nic and Jack met to develop a scientific narrative for why this land has unique value for farming/vegetable production. Jack grows a wide diversity of crops. This is an important part of risk management; grow cool season and warm season crops in different areas, use microclimates on the farm strategically, buffer against risk Requires a significant skillset to manage all these different types of crops For cover crops, they use rye/vetch mix and oats/peas mix. Tries to keep ground covered as much as possible. They also use mycorrhizal amendments in the transplant water This is an organic farm, but that doesn’t mean it’s a low-input farm; they do lots of micro-amending with Cu, Zn, S, Ca. Jack has great horticultural students putting their knowledge to work on the farm His fields are organized in 4 acre blocks, and 80% of the fields have soil tests every year Distinction between adding microamendments to the SOIL vs. crop managers doing plant nutrient management during the season depending on the needs of the crop. Featherstone Farm Soils We will be looking at the Waukegan series here – this is the same series as our experimental field at UMN The general Waukegan concept is loess over outwash (not the case here). Silt loam over very fine sandy loam over medium [sandy loam] à this is exactly what we would expect to see in an oxbow We found carbonates in this soil – surprising because this is the wettest part of the state Generally, parent material for Waukegan is loess over outwash. Depth to outwash (sand) on true Waukegans is very consistent. In contrast, on this landscape depth to sand is much more variable Here in Jack’s field, the parent materials is alluvium (For all cores we are looking at). This fits morphologically into the Waukegan box, but it has a different parent material than the general Waukegan Nic mention Beth post-doc trying to develop crop productivity indices For alluvium – coarser textured sand in main channel. Finer sand in backwaters (like an oxbow lake or backwater swamp We see fining upward here in these cores – this is consistent with alluvium deposition here. It is very different from the abrupt transition between coarse sand and silt [that you can see in the campus experimental fields??] Compared to other Waukegans the class has seen, these have thicker A horizons, more organic matter. * Likely more plant available water because of depth of silt We are looking at a drainage sequence left to right here [[Sharon took picture of grouping]] Surprisingly – carbonates present all over the place, including the sand! 2 reasons we might see carbonates here: Some calcareous material coming down from upland part of alluvium is rich in carbonates. Could have contributed carbonate-rich loess We are close to the water table here, this can draw carbonates up through evaporative action Classification for these soils: (typic) hapludolls These soils have A horizons that are approximately 2X as deep as most Waukegans. 2-3% more organic matter. The sand is deeper here but still allows water to drain Carbonates buoy up pH to ~7 here These soils have been cut off from river sediment for 1000s of years (order of magnitude) Don’t see stacks of A horizons here, but might see something like that down closer to river We are relatively disconnected from the uplands, this landform not conducive to post-settlement alluvium deposition 11.2 2 cores from neighbor’s field (near Featherstone Farm) We saw a typic hapludoll and an entic hapludoll here. This is a terrace from Pleistocene era flooding Typic hapludoll: Silt loam Sandy loam Med sand Coarse sand Entic hapludoll: textures are all medium sands This is an old terrace from the Root River - parent material is old alluvium No effervescence - totally disconnected from local hydrology Plant growth is terrible on the sand splits - these are old sand bars that were in the river Aspect matters a lot on these landscapes SW slopes get more solar radiation at hotter times of day. Would have been prairie historically On west slopes would have seen savannah/ scattered trees North slopes - mesic hardwood forests, basswood, maple Sediment load and flow are balanced in a river. Rivers can be flowing and depositing or flowing and incising. Amount of erosion and sediment being fed into the river, flow volume determines threshold of deposition If you look at aerial pictures of crops during peak growth - the sand spits stick out (because crop growth is so bad) Jack tells story about 2 acres of carrots in the fields near this sandy field - there was a huge difference in flavor between the carrots grown on the black soil vs the sandy soil! Eventually he gave up on the sandy field - it was a headache to irrigate. Workers called it the “Zone of Death” Jack is experimenting with introducing cattle in a new rotation on the highly erodible soils, taking them out of vegetable production for up to 3 years Typically the ridges in this area are farmed at the top/summit with pasture along the edge (bird’s eye view picture. AM RECAP PICTURE Morning Recap at Featherstone We started out by looking at floodplain soil - silt loams over sands. The red cedars we saw on the SW slopes would not have been there pre-settlement Impact of Aspect on Soil Development (Featherstone Farm) We will see that aspect completely changes the soil type, vegetation, moisture, and temperature regimes* Summit - parent material is loess. Pretty uniform color and appearance (which is weird!) Thin A horizon here. These ridges have been farmed since European settlement - this is a highly eroded version of the soil that was once here. Silt loams on narrow ridgetops with drainage that goes directly to the river. Erosion has a big impact on water quality here. Marginal alfisol (hapludalf) or entisol (distrudept). Ap - silt loam Bt- silty clay loam C - silt loam SW Slope - Goat prairie! Now it is filled with red cedar. Hot and dry environment, droughty. In some spots not even red cedars will grow. The cedar stands on the steep slopes in the driftless can be a compass pointing SW Native vegetation here would have been upland dry prairie (almost xeric) Lithic Hapludoll - parent material is loess. Special rule when mollic horizon sits directly over bedrock - only need 10cm to qualify as mollic A1 A2 R Upland/Ridge Eroded savannah soil, Typic Hapludalf, parent material is loess Ap Bt C NE Slope Forming partly from loess over residuum. It’s 8-10 degrees coler on N slope, especially under tree canopy Lithic Hapludalf Native/historic vegetation here would have been mesis oak basswood forest. A- 15 cm E - 40cm 2Bt "],
["the-driftless-ii.html", "Chapter 12 The Driftless II 12.1 Hyde Park Holsteins 12.2 Quarry 12.3 Catena in Kevin's cornfield 12.4 Dry Creek Farms", " Chapter 12 The Driftless II June 7, 2019 Morning Review Brad, Grant &amp; Dawn are unique as farms on the Des Moines Lobe till because they have animals in corn country The topography in the Driftless area drives diverse land use 12.1 Hyde Park Holsteins Introducing Kevin Sewert (sp?) and herdsman Eric Milking parlor This is a pretty advanced set-up; data on each cow is tracked and associated with a number recognized by the milking machine 90 cows can be milked each hour 3 milking times per day. 2am, 10am, 6pm Soon they will be expanding the barn to hold more cows. They will transition to a 24 hour/day operation Produce 6500 gallons of milk per day Talking to Kevin One challenge is figuring out how to use the manure that is generated. Tillage is required to incorporate it into the fields They use all strip-till on the farm. This is in contrast to many neighbors who also grow corn and soy Dairy was built in 1995 Each cow produced 110lb milk per day They have started using sand bedding for the cows. This allows the cows to stay cleaner and measures of milk quality to increase (somatic cell count - lower is better) They group cows together based on how quickly they milk - the slow milkers go together Takes 4-5 minutes to milk one cow The cows have pedometers that can track how active they are- this is a good indicator of who is in estrus McDonalds is a big guyer of dairy cow meat Improved genetics are an important part of their program for raising productive cows. They use genomics for selecting bulls, 4H animals Manure management - now that they have switched to sand on the ground for manure, needed to install a flume so they can flush manure out of barn, reclaim sand Cow nutrition What is silage? It is the entire green part of the plant, chopped fine. It is apprx 72% water, should not be able to see corn kernels in ideal silage On this farm, 300 acres silage and 500 acres hay Key to making good feed is right moisture, pack tight In addition to silage, they use a number of byproducts to blend feed for the cows Whey product Cotton seeds Ground up corn Canola seed Cows diets should be balanced on amino acids Costs $9/cow / day to feed This is the highest producing herd in the state(in terms of milk per cow), maybe top 20 in nation. Kevin attributes this to good people Discussion of BST (Bovine somatotrophin) - processors said they wouldn't take any milk with BST, cost the business money. Kevin talks about the importance of consumers understanding the utility of technology in farming businesses. Technology needs to be used to benefit society Farm Background &amp; History History of farm 1942 Grandpa bought farm 1970 Kevin left teaching - he was a professor of Ruminant Nutrition at the University of I (Illinois? Iowa?), came back home to farm 1995 - up until this point milked 60 cows More about manure management - with a CAFO permit you can't have any runoff from the facility, have to collect every drop of manure Can apply to land within 5 miles (fact check this) Must collect water from any cement an animal has touched. In a 1 inch rain they collect 1 million gallons of water They inject the manure into the fields with a tractor implmement They collect so much water that the N in the manure is diluted. Real value of the manure is the P and K it can provide the crop They apply manure in Oct/Nov. Cool temps important to make sure you aren't losing N (through denitrification) Come back in the spring and sidedress with a little N to provide what the crops need All soil grid tested every 3 years to check on where it is OK to apply the cyclone lime they use as bedding for the heifers. Don't want soil pH to rise too high In general, rising costs to run the business. They need to stay in a growth phase to be viable Kevin's son Justin wants to come back home and farm Where is the milk sold? AMPI (cheese) in Rochester. Also sell to a company in Blair WI that makes powdered dry milk. Milk is processed by different facilities into fluid, powder, cheese Kevin talks about divisions among farmers based on practices - organic vs conventional Kevin's biggest concern is erosion. Drain tile works very well for him, says it makes a huge difference in the wet heavy spots. Next spring they will be trenching again for tile - Nic wants to drive down! 12.2 Quarry This used to be agricultural land See loess over limestone/sandstone residuum here Good clay films - illuviation down through loess into reddish residuum Residuum - sandy gravelly clay loam What is saprolite - things that retain original rock structure but are chemically modified Limestone residuum is typically redder. When limestone weathers, everything dissolves except impurities like iron and titanium Limesonte residuum is clayier and redder. Typically has cherty coarse fragments 12.3 Catena in Kevin's cornfield Summit: Mt Carrol Series - deep loess. Mollic hapludalf (savannah type). Argillic horizon likely Backslope (convex): convex in profile and plan view. No clay pick-up. Less infiltration to illuviate clay on backslope compared to summit. This is a typic hapludalf. This is a water-shedding landform Backslope (concave): Even wetter than depression soil? This is a mollisol, unlike the convex backslope. We are looking at an oxiaquic hapludoll Footslope: Very dark colors, cumulic hapluodll. The upland positions in this catena are eroded from tillage and water erosion You find the best argillics on the summit positions of these landscapes Typically find the thickest loess on the East side of the Mississippi River because winds typically trend W to E. 12.4 Dry Creek Farms 6/7/19 John &amp; Jared Luhman Manage 700 acres land, 250 organic cropping and 450 pasture/hay for forage and feed Approx 200 cows, raise bulls Cover crops - hay or graze. Plant sorghum sudan grass. Usually they leave the sorghum sudan in the ground until fall, graze it in the winter. This helps them reduce their feeding costs in the winter, which is the most expensive time Using annual cover crops has been a great way to reduce winter feed costs. They are typically grazing until the first week of January! This saves 2-3 months of costs, labor, time. Since they started grazing the sorghum sudan, they have seen great soil improvements. Less weed pressure. They are working with some no-till farmers this year, experimenting with bringing their cows over to other peoples farms to graze down cornstalks and help improve a poor field with bad soil. Cost comparison In winter $3 per cow per day to feed $1.60 per cow per day grazing cover crops $0.50 per cow per day grazing corn stalks In the livestock industry, animals have been separated from the land. Crops and animal production systems have been separated. As people move toward more integrative systems, there are great opportunities for crop farmers and livestock farmers to work togehter Perennial weeds are their biggest problem when moving to no-till in an organic system. Probably need to till every couple years to control weeds. In 1962 they bought the farm. Converted to organic in 2000 They see the harm in tillage now more than they did before. Like Grant and Dawn, John and Jared emphasize thinking about profit per acre, not maximum production as the overall goal. Hypothetical question; if you are pursuing maximum production, what happens when you are totally dependent on outside intpus and debt just to run your business? John and Jared are working hard to develop a self-sustaining system - part of this is the type of cattle they raise. They have smaller framed animals. This allows them to produce more pounds of animal and more profit per acre compared to bigger animals. (Can fit more small animals per acre). Bigger calf means bigger cow means more feed! Smaller animals can be more efficient in their system. Adapting animals to fit the system They only keep animals that fit their system - let the environment decide They breed for a more moderate size of cattle. Big cattle need a system based on corn - moderate sized animals can survive just on forage. They breed primarily Red Angus cows Takes John and Jared 18-21 to finish a grass-fed cow. The conventional beef industry takes 15 months Most of the beef industry is calving January and February. When calving, cows need the best, most high quality forage (Jan and Feb not a good time for this!). John and Jared calve in May when they can take advantage of high quality grass in the spring and early summer. For animals, think about maintenance energy. The conventional dairy industry is looking for maximum milk production. No energy left for the animal to put on fat or get rebred From John &amp; Jared's perspective, farming is about turning solar energy into carbon and BEEF. Leaves are their solar panels! &quot;Sunlight is the only free resource farmers get&quot; (quote from Jared) Perennials and grasses can capture more C for more of the year than corn Building organic matter and C in soil benefits the whole system - trying to capitalize on that Emphasizes thinking about the sustainability of the whole system. It's more than just the animal There are many benefits to a more diverse diet for animals. Their animals have fewer health issues now that they are eating a more diverse diet. Diveristy in pasture species is important too - this year they will have 11 different species in the annual pasture The majority of their animals go to wholesale. Jared and his wife are growing a direct-market beef businesses. &quot;The Grassfed Meat Market&quot; They see perennial pasture as a middle ground between organic (including tillage) and a conventional spray system Currently they buy and apply some manure, but hoping that after this year cover crops will supply N for their corn crop Books recommended by John and Jared - Gabe Brown's &quot;Dirt to Soil&quot; and &quot;How Cows Save the Planet&quot;&quot; In spring, there is a risk of the cows walking on wet soil and compacting it Giant ragweed is biggest problem weed for them Jared has started business called Grassfed Cattle Company with his wife 12.4.1 Soil at Dry Creek Farms Most soils on the farm have about 3% organic matter. Some long term pasture areas are at 6% At the summit: silt loam, some clay pick up. If argillic horizon is absent here, probably due to erosion. Savannah type A horizon. Depression: Original soil surface is all the way down at 40cm. Can see where the color gets darker. Textures all silt loams - recall that silt loams are the most erodible soil type Des Moines Lobe - buffers as management strategy Driftless - see many more conservation ag practices. Topography and soil type can make management challenging Period of maximum erosion in Driftless area -has already passed based on isotope data [Nic references papers about this] Studies of 1960s-1980s peak sediment in Lake Pepin People in the area don’t use moldboard plow much anymore, HOWEVER, one current issue is when people take separate fields (with different soil types &amp; topography) and combine them into one big section rather than using contour strips which take a longer time to plant. John thinks people around here don’t want to take the extra time to plant and deal with contour strips John reports a “gully washing rain” a few days ego - erosion was evident in neighboring fields Soil conservation is an ongoing battle that everyone is involved in. Consumers drive land use patterns with consumption.
